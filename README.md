# Question: How do you evaluate an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `evaluateRPN` takes an array of strings as input, which represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It initializes an empty stack to store the numbers in the expression. The function then iterates over each token in the input array. If the token is a number (determined by attempting to parse the token as an integer and checking if the result is not NaN), it is pushed onto the stack. If the token is an operator, the function pops the top two numbers from the stack, performs the operation indicated by the operator on these two numbers, and then pushes the result back onto the stack. The specific operation performed depends on the operator: "+" adds the two numbers, "-" subtracts the second number from the first, "*" multiplies the two numbers, and "/" divides the first number by the second (with the result rounded towards zero). After all tokens have been processed, the function returns the final result by popping the top number from the stack. This approach effectively evaluates the RPN expression by handling the numbers and operations in the order they appear, using the stack to store intermediate results.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript solution is very similar to the JavaScript solution, but it has some differences due to TypeScript's static typing feature:

1. Type Annotations: In TypeScript, we can specify the type of variables, function parameters, and function return values. In the TypeScript solution, the `tokens` parameter is annotated as `string[]` (an array of strings), the `stack` variable is annotated as `number[]` (an array of numbers), and the function `evaluateRPN` is declared to return a `number`.

2. Type Assertion: TypeScript uses type assertion (using `as` keyword) to tell the compiler "trust me, I know what I'm doing". In the TypeScript solution, `stack.pop()` is asserted as `number` because TypeScript cannot infer that `stack.pop()` will always return a number (it could return `undefined` if the stack is empty).

3. Use of `Number` instead of `parseInt`: In the TypeScript solution, `Number(token)` is used instead of `parseInt(token)`. This is because `Number` is more strict than `parseInt` and will return `NaN` for strings that don't represent a valid number, while `parseInt` will try to parse as much as it can and ignore the rest.

4. Use of `includes` instead of `isNaN`: In the TypeScript solution, `operators.includes(token)` is used to check if the token is an operator. This is more straightforward and readable than using `!isNaN(parseInt(token))` to check if the token is not a number.

Overall, the TypeScript solution is more robust and less error-prone due to the use of static typing and type assertion. It also improves readability by using `includes` and `Number`.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution also uses a stack to evaluate the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression, similar to the JavaScript version. However, there are some differences due to the language features and methods used in each version.

1. Input Handling: In the JavaScript version, the input is an array of strings. In the C++ version, the input is a single string from the standard input, which is then split into a vector of strings using a custom `split` function.

2. Stack: Both versions use a stack to store the numbers. In JavaScript, an array is used as a stack with the `push` and `pop` methods. In C++, the `std::stack` container is used, which provides `push`, `pop`, and `top` methods.

3. Number Conversion: In JavaScript, `parseInt` is used to convert a string to a number. In C++, `std::stoi` is used for the same purpose.

4. Loop: In JavaScript, a `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the tokens. In C++, a traditional `for` loop with an index is used.

5. Division Operation: In JavaScript, the division operation checks if the result is positive or negative and uses `Math.floor` or `Math.ceil` accordingly to ensure the result is an integer. In C++, integer division is used, which automatically discards the fractional part.

6. Output: In JavaScript, the result is returned from the function. In C++, the result is printed to the standard output.

7. Error Handling: Neither version includes error handling for invalid inputs or operations. For example, if there are not enough numbers in the stack for an operation, both versions will fail.
